A file manager for your media library. Organize your attachments, photos, and other media items into folders, and easily filter items by folder when you add them to posts and pages!

== Description ==

Acclectic Media Organizer creates a virtual file system that lets you better organize attachments and everything in your media library. Simply create folders and subfolders, and then drag and drop items directly within the media library. When you are ready to use attachments in your content, find them easily by selecting their folder. No more sifting through thousands of items to find the right one!

== Features ==

**Hierarchical File System**
Create folders and subfolders, just like in a real file system.

**Virtual File System**

A detailed upload status tracker keeps you up-to-date when uploading many files to a folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any limits to this plugin? =
No. All supported features are fully available to you with no limits of any kind.

= Will my media files and attachments be moved when I assign them to folders? =
No. Acclectic Media Organizer creates a virtual file system for organization. All of your existing files will be kept in their existing physical folders, and any links pointing to them will continue to work without change.

= What if I've used other file organization plugins in the past? =
Since Acclectic Media Organizer creates a separate virtual file system, any organization you make will not be affected by any similar plugins you've used in the past or may use in the future.

= Can I export my media folders to another server or computer? =
The plugin does not support doing so directly within the plugin, but it is a feature we plan to include in the future. However, it is possible to do so by exporting and importing the database tables that host the virtual file system. Please contact support if you'd like help on this.

= If I rearrange or delete folders, will I lose my files? =
No. When you move or rearrange folders, the files will keep their assigned folders. When you delete a folder, items in the folder will simply become unassigned, but will never be deleted from the file system.

= Can I move multiple files at a time? =
Yes! In the grid view, simply enable *Bulk select*. Then drag all items to the destination folder. In the list view, select multiple items with check-boxes, and then drag them to the destination folder.
